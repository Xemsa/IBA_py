For Legend Path purposes, could anyone tell me what are things that stack ? I heard BAB and caster level and pet level only goes up to 20 so it makes no sense to get more than 20 levels of fighter just for BAB (or whatever the equivalent is at 40 for average BAB); I know that e.g. Studied Target stacks. What else does?
